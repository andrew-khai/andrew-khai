### Fun Facts
* I am a huge basketball fan üèÄ My NBA team is the Los Angeles Lakers of course and I try to also play basektball as much as possible since it was my first passion and I've been playing every since I was 5 years old!
* When I'm not coding I enjoy learning new things/picking up new hobbies. My most recent hobby has been learning how to golf ‚õ≥Ô∏è , I can't hit with any club other than a driver but the progress is coming along!
